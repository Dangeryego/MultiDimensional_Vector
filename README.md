# MultiDimensional_Vector
A dynamic array which contains more than two dimensions
In this project two vectors are created namely vector_1 & vector_2 
Elements are added in these vectors by a vector function called push_back
The push_back function allows the element to be added in the last index
Both the vector's size is obtained by .size function
Then both the vectors are added to a multidimentional vector called 2d_vector
A 'Dynamic multifunctional array' is created
Later an element is added in vector_1 to test whether it does change the 2d_vector or not
